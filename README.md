# Purpose
* Supreme Project was developed for automating the task of counting the number of cylindrical plastic pipes at Supreme Industries.
* Instead of searching for pipes of all sizes, the user can choose to input an expected pipe size and make the software count faster.   
* It thresholds & segments the pipes from the background and the hough's circle transform helps us identify the circles.
* To avoid false negatives and false positives, the GUI is assisted with an option to highlight the positions of the circles.

A sample view of the GUI:
